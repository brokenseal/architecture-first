# architecture-first
A first attempt to find the best architecture layout for a frontend application

# What defines a good architecture?
The quest to the best structure for a frontend application, or for any
application for that matters, is not easy and I strongly believe it's not a
fit-for-all solution. That said, I find it is still important to define one,
if for anything, at least to stay away from the spaghetti-code.

I believe this is a quest into the unknown with only a couple of clear points:

1. separation of concerns
2. favor immutability over mutating objects
3. favor pure functions over impure ones
